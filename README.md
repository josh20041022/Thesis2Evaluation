# Davao Food Finder

A small server-rendered site using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. No Laravel, Node.js, npm, or frontend build step is required.

## Requirements
- PHP 8.1 or newer with the `curl` and `mbstring` extensions enabled
- Composer, to install the PHP dependencies
- The `zip` and `xml` PHP extensions if you want to read Excel files (`.xlsx` or `.xls`)

## Run the app (Windows PowerShell)
1. Open PowerShell in the repository folder (the folder containing `davao_food_finder`) and enter the app folder:
   ```powershell
   cd .\davao_food_finder
   ```
2. Install the PHP dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```
3. (Optional) Set an OpenAI API key in this PowerShell window to enable AI answers and live web search. The secure prompt hides the key while you enter it:
   ```powershell
   $secureKey = Read-Host 'OpenAI API key' -AsSecureString
   $env:OPENAI_API_KEY = [System.Net.NetworkCredential]::new('', $secureKey).Password
   ```
   Verify PHP can see that a key is set without printing it:
   ```powershell
   php -r "echo trim((string) getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')) === '' ? 'PHP: MISSING' : 'PHP: SET';"
   ```
   If a PHP server is already running, stop it first with **Ctrl+C** in its terminal. If there is no accessible terminal, stop the process using its current PID. For example:
   ```powershell
   Stop-Process -Id 7632
   ```
   Only use `7632` if you have confirmed it is still the PHP server process; process IDs can change between runs.
4. Start the server from this same PowerShell window so it inherits the key:
   ```powershell
   Set-Location 'The file location of this app'
   & 'C:\xampp\php\php.exe' -d extension=gd -S 127.0.0.1:8080 -t .
   ```
   If XAMPP or the project is installed elsewhere, adjust the PHP executable and project folder paths. Without a key, the app can still show matches from the local dataset. Keep the key on the server: do not put it in `Main.html` or browser JavaScript, and do not commit a real key to source control. The app is configured to use `gpt-4o-mini`.
5. Open [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080) in your browser. Keep the PowerShell window open while using the app; press **Ctrl+C** there to stop the server.

Run the commands in the same PowerShell window so the optional API key is available to PHP. The PHP server serves `index.php`, which redirects to `Main.html`. Do not open `Main.html` as a `file://` URL or use a static-only preview extension: searches need PHP to handle `api.php`.

On macOS/Linux, use `cd davao_food_finder`, `composer install`, optionally set `OPENAI_API_KEY`, then run `php -S 127.0.0.1:8080` from the same terminal.

## Automated evaluation
The `evaluation/test_queries.json` file contains labeled Davao City queries and relevant restaurant names. With the app server running, execute:

```powershell
php .\evaluation\run_evaluation.php
```

The script calls the app's JSON API and prints per-query Precision@5 for local dataset results, mean and median end-to-end request latency, and constraint-adherence rate:

- **Precision@5:** \(P@5 = \frac{\text{relevant local results in the first 5}}{5}\). Relevance is labeled by restaurant name in the test file. Precision is useful here because it measures how many displayed local recommendations match the user's cuisine request; the fixed denominator also penalizes returning fewer than five matches.
- **Latency:** mean and median elapsed seconds per API request, from sending the query until receiving the response. This reflects user-perceived response time and includes OpenAI/web-search time when configured.
- **Constraint adherence:** \(\frac{\text{responses passing all checks}}{\text{valid API responses}}\). Checks cover the response shape, result limits, non-empty restaurant names, Davao City locations, and URL-free assistant text; these constraints reflect the app's location scope and display requirements.

The current evaluation fixes the model to `gpt-4o-mini` and the ranking cutoff to \(k=5\); it does not train a model or perform hyperparameter tuning. Since this evaluates one system on one dataset, it does not claim statistical significance from model-comparison tests. To require a configured, successful OpenAI response for every case, add `--require-ai`. Set a different API URL with `--url=http://127.0.0.1:8080/api.php`.

Latency includes the full API request and, when configured, OpenAI and live web-search time. Live API calls may incur charges. The precision ground truth evaluates local dataset ranking; live web recommendations are dynamic and are checked for constraints rather than against static relevance labels. The included three labeled cases are a starter dataset, not enough to establish thesis-level generalization; expand and independently review the labels before reporting results.

## What works
- Chat-style search with multi-turn follow-ups such as “show me more”, “what about Japanese food?”, or “similar but cheaper”.
- OpenAI's Responses API searches the live web for each request and returns structured restaurant recommendations that appear as cards with cuisine, available ratings, price, location, and a Google Maps directions button. AI replies stay concise; restaurant details and directions are shown in the cards. Local Davao City dataset matches are shown separately as additional recommendations. Conversation history supports follow-up questions. No separate OpenAI SDK install is needed for this PHP project.
- Recommendations are limited to Davao City. Requests for another location receive a brief clarification instead of AI or dataset recommendations; online recommendations are only displayed when their city is verified as Davao City.
- The app uses `gpt-4o-mini`, a lower-cost model. Model tokens and built-in web search may still incur API charges; web search is billed separately from model tokens.
- The page identifies the configured model and updates to the model name returned by OpenAI after a successful AI response.
- Results remain grouped under the query that produced them. Straightforward restaurant requests show results without repetitive canned replies; OpenAI can respond conversationally when an answer is useful.
- CSVs are scanned in a streaming manner; imported place records are cached in `data/.places-cache.json` to avoid re-reading large files every query. The cache is rebuilt when dataset file names, sizes, or modified times change. To force a rebuild, delete that cache file.
- Dataset city filtering requires the detected `City` field to contain `Davao City`. Other Davao Region cities are excluded.
- Restaurant details show dataset ratings/reviewer counts and a Google Maps search link. Price and address details show “not available” if the dataset doesn't contain them.
- If OpenAI or web search is unconfigured or unavailable, relevant local matching is still shown as a fallback.

## Notes
- The model is fixed to `gpt-4o-mini` to avoid accidentally using a more expensive model through an `OPENAI_MODEL` environment setting. The project calls the Responses API REST endpoint with its web search tool directly; check model access, web search availability, and API key status in the OpenAI dashboard if live search cannot respond.
- Put restaurant and review datasets in `data/`. CSV files are read directly; Excel files (`.xlsx`/`.xls`) require the PHP extensions listed above. The included `ph_restos_2025.csv` and `ph_reviews_2025.csv` files are already in `data/`.
- The review CSV is aggregated by `StoreId` and can take a little time on the first request. After the cache is built, normal requests should be faster.
- If you have multiple copies of the same restaurant/review dataset in `data/`, review counts can be double-counted. Prefer keeping one current version of each dataset.
- Web information is generated from live search and displayed in restaurant cards with Google Maps directions. Local result cards remain grounded in the supplied dataset; the app does not fabricate missing prices, addresses, or review scores.
